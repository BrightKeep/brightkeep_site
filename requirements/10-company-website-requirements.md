## 2. Brand Identity

### Brand Personality
Experienced but not stuffy. Technical but accessible. Confident without arrogance. The energy of a senior practitioner who has shipped real things and can help you do the same.

### Colour Palette

**Recommended: Blue + Electric Orange**

| Role | Colour | Hex | Usage |
|------|--------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Deep Navy | `#1B2A4A` | Headers, navigation, footer, primary text |
| Primary Light | Steel Blue | `#3A6B9F` | Secondary headings, borders, hover states |
| Accent | Electric Orange | `#FF6B35` | CTAs, highlights, active states, key stats |
| Background | Off-White | `#F8F9FA` | Page background, card backgrounds |
| Surface | White | `#FFFFFF` | Card surfaces, content areas |
| Text Primary | Charcoal | `#2D2D2D` | Body copy |
| Text Secondary | Slate | `#6B7280` | Supporting text, captions |
| Success | Teal | `#0D9488` | Trust indicators, checkmarks |

**Why orange over pink or yellow:**
- Orange carries energy and confidence without the playfulness of pink or the caution associations of yellow
- Navy + orange is a classic credibility-plus-action pairing (think consulting meets startup energy)
- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA compliant against both dark and light backgrounds)
- Reads well across screens and in print

**Alternative accent options if orange doesn't land:**
- Coral Pink: `#FF6B6B` - warmer, more approachable, slightly softer
- Amber: `#F59E0B` - energetic, optimistic, pairs well with navy but lower contrast

### Typography Suggestions

| Role | Recommendation | Fallback |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Headings | Inter (700, 600) | system-ui, sans-serif |
| Body | Inter (400, 500) | system-ui, sans-serif |
| Mono/Code | JetBrains Mono | monospace |

Inter is clean, professional, excellent readability at all sizes, and free via Google Fonts. Single font family keeps load times tight.

## 3. Page Structure & Required Copy

The page follows a single continuous scroll with distinct sections. Each section has a clear job.

---

### Section 1: Hero

**Job:** Establish who you are and what you do in under 5 seconds.

**Layout:** Full-width hero with navy background, white text, accent CTA button. No hero image required - clean typographic hero with subtle geometric pattern or gradient.

**Required Copy:**

> **Headline:**
> Digital Solutions. Decades of Delivery.
>
> **Subheadline:**
> [COMPANY NAME] is a digital business and product development company. We build technology solutions and consult on delivery practices that actually work - founded on real-world experience shipping in the digital sector.
>
> **CTA Button:**
> Talk to Us

---

### Section 2: What We Do

**Job:** Clearly communicate the two service pillars within 15 seconds of scrolling.

**Layout:** Two-column card layout on desktop, stacked on mobile. Each card has an icon, heading, summary and 3-4 bullet points. Off-white background.

**Required Copy:**

> **Section Heading:**
> What We Do
>
> **Card 1 - Digital Product Development**
>
> We design, build and ship digital solutions that solve real customer and business problems. From concept through to production, we deliver software that works in the hands of the people who use it.
>
> - Custom web and mobile applications
> - AI-integrated solutions focused on measurable outcomes
> - API design and system integration
> - End-to-end product delivery from discovery to launch
>
> **Card 2 - Digital Delivery Consulting**
>
> We help teams deliver better, faster and more sustainably. Our consulting is grounded in industry best practices and tailored to where your organisation actually is - not where a framework assumes you should be.
>
> - Agile coaching and delivery transformation
> - DORA metrics implementation and engineering performance
> - DevOps and platform engineering practices
> - Engineering operations (EngOps) and team effectiveness

---

### Section 3: How We Work

**Job:** Differentiate from generic agencies. Show the methodology and values.

**Layout:** Three-column icon grid on desktop, stacked on mobile. Navy section with white text and accent icon highlights.

**Required Copy:**

> **Section Heading:**
> How We Work
>
> **Tile 1 - Problem First**
> We start with the customer or business problem, not the technology. Solutions are shaped by outcomes, not tool preferences.
>
> **Tile 2 - Evidence Over Opinion**
> We measure what matters. DORA metrics, cycle time, deployment frequency - real signals that tell you whether delivery is improving.
>
> **Tile 3 - Ship and Learn**
> Small increments, real feedback, continuous improvement. We favour working software over comprehensive documentation and adjust course based on what we learn.
>
> **Tile 4 - AI Where It Counts**
> We integrate AI capabilities where they solve genuine problems - not as a buzzword, but as a practical tool that improves outcomes for customers and operations.
>
> **Tile 5 - Sustainable Pace**
> Burnout is not a delivery strategy. We build practices that teams can maintain long after we leave.
>
> **Tile 6 - Your Capability, Not Ours**
> Our goal is to make ourselves unnecessary. We transfer knowledge, build internal capability and leave your team stronger than we found them.
