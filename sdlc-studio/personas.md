**Technical Proficiency:** Intermediate
**Primary Goal:** Find a trustworthy partner to build or improve a digital product

### Background

Makes buying decisions quickly when trust is established. Typically finds BrightKeep through search, LinkedIn, or a referral.

- Mobile-friendly experience (often browsing on phone between meetings)

### Pain Points
- Has been burned by agencies that over-promised and under-delivered
- Frustrated by websites full of jargon and no clear services list
- Doesn't want to fill in a 15-field form just to have a chat
- Sceptical of consultancies that don't show practical experience
- Time-poor and will bounce quickly if the site doesn't load fast or look credible

### Typical Tasks
- Lands on hero, scans headline and subheadline (< 5 seconds)
- Scrolls to "What We Do" to check if product development is offered
- Skims "How We Work" to assess cultural fit
- Scrolls to contact form and submits a short enquiry
- Checks footer for ABN and location to verify legitimacy

## Leader Lee

**Role:** CTO / Head of Product / Engineering Manager
**Technical Proficiency:** Expert
**Primary Goal:** Engage a consultancy to improve engineering delivery practices and team performance

### Background
Lee leads an engineering organisation (20-200 people) at a mid-size company or scale-up. The team is shipping but not as effectively as they should be. Lee has heard of DORA metrics and wants to improve cycle time, deployment frequency, and developer experience. Typically researches consultancies on desktop during work hours and evaluates them critically.

### Needs & Motivations
- Evidence of deep technical credibility (not surface-level agile coaching)
- Specific consulting offerings listed (DORA metrics, DevOps, EngOps)
- A sense that this consultancy builds capability rather than creating dependency
- Reassurance that the approach will be tailored, not a cookie-cutter framework
- Professional presentation that they'd feel comfortable sharing with their leadership team

### Pain Points
- Has worked with "agile coaches" who lacked real engineering experience
- Frustrated by consultancies that create dependency rather than building internal capability
- Needs to justify the engagement to CFO/CEO - requires credible digital presence
- Wary of buzzword-heavy sites that mention AI without substance
- Wants to assess quickly whether consulting covers their specific needs (EngOps, DORA, DevOps)

### Typical Tasks
- Lands on hero, quickly assesses positioning and credibility
- Navigates directly to "What We Do" consulting card
- Reads "How We Work" in detail, looking for methodology alignment
- Checks "Services" detail list for specific consulting capabilities
- Opens contact form, writes a detailed message about their situation
- May share the site URL with a peer or their CEO for a second opinion

### Quote
> "We don't need more process. We need someone who understands engineering and can help us actually get better at shipping."

## Enterprise Erin

**Role:** Digital Transformation Lead / Head of Technology / Procurement Manager

### Background
Erin works at a large enterprise (500+ employees) that recognises its digital delivery is behind industry standards. They've been tasked with finding an external partner to help transform how the organisation builds and ships software. The decision involves multiple stakeholders and a formal evaluation process.

### Needs & Motivations
- A credible, professional web presence that passes internal due diligence

- Easy access to contact information and company details (ABN, location)
- Content they can share internally to build a case for engagement
- Privacy policy and legal compliance visible (enterprise procurement requirement)

### Pain Points
- Risk-averse organisation requires external partners to look established and credible
- Previous transformation attempts have failed due to consultancies that didn't understand their context
- Needs to evaluate multiple vendors and differentiate quickly
- Procurement requires verifiable business details (ABN, registered location)
- Concerned about consultancies that only work with startups and can't handle enterprise complexity

### Typical Tasks
- Lands on site, assesses overall professionalism and credibility (< 10 seconds)
- Reads all sections methodically, top to bottom
- Checks both development and consulting service offerings
- Verifies company details in footer (ABN, location, email)
- Reads Privacy Policy (procurement due diligence)
- Sends link to colleagues before making contact
- Submits detailed enquiry via form with company name and specific needs
